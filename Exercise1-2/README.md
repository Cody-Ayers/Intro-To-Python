# Data Types in Python

## Task 1

- I have chosen to go with dictionaries for my data structure. This structure will work best for the recipes due to the different data types that are being used in the recipes. This will also be the data structure I will use for all recipes. This will allow me to add recipes as I go as well as delete ones I don't need.
